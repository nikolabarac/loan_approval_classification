# Loan Approval Classification Project

## ðŸ“š Project Overview  
Loan approval decisions are critical for financial institutions, as they determine the allocation of funds and mitigate risks. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify loan candidates based on their features, predicting whether they are suitable for loan approval.  

The solution is designed to be versatile: it can automatically classify candidates or serve as a decision-support tool for human evaluators. If needed, the model can be configured to provide probabilities as output, enhancing transparency and aiding human reviewers in making informed decisions.
